================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: The function 'util.GetTokenInHeaderAndVerify' does not seem to implement rate limiting which could allow attackers to perform brute force attacks on token verification.
Solution: Implement rate limiting middleware in the authentication process to prevent brute force attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Error messages returned directly to the client might contain sensitive information about the backend logic or database structure.
Solution: Ensure that error messages are sanitized before they are sent to the client or use generic error messages for client responses.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: There is no explicit check to ensure that the 'req.UserID' belongs to the authenticated user, which might allow an authenticated user to access another user's graph data.
Solution: Add authorization checks to verify that the 'req.UserID' is the same as the authenticated user's ID.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: While the 'db.GetAccountsGraphParams' structure is used to pass parameters, if any part of the SQL query is constructed dynamically without proper sanitization, it might be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Always use parameterized queries or stored procedures to prevent SQL injection. Ensure that no part of the SQL query is constructed dynamically with user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Issue: The 'getAccountGraph' function does not implement any resource limits or throttling which could lead to resource exhaustion if the function is called repeatedly in a short amount of time.
Solution: Implement request throttling and set sensible limits on the number of concurrent requests that can be handled.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function does not check for the error from 'ctx.ShouldBindUri' and proceeds even if there is an error, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: After calling 'ctx.ShouldBindUri', check for an error and return an appropriate response to the client before proceeding.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of account graph data

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly retrieves account graph data when provided with valid user ID and account type, and there is no error in token validation or data fetching.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock context with a valid request and set up the server with a mock store that returns a successful result for `GetAccountsGraph`.
  Act: Invoke `getAccountGraph` with the mock context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is `http.StatusOK` and the response body contains the expected account graph data.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the function operates as expected under normal conditions. It confirms that the correct data is returned when the service can retrieve it without any errors. This test is crucial to ensure that the function fulfills its primary purpose of displaying account graph data to the user.

Scenario 2: Token validation fails

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function responds appropriately when token validation fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock context with a request that fails token validation and set up the server without a need for a mock store since the operation should not proceed to data fetching.
  Act: Invoke `getAccountGraph` with the mock context.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns early and does not produce a response, as the token validation error should prevent further execution.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function does not proceed when there is a token validation error. This is important for security reasons, as the function should not reveal any data if the user cannot be authenticated.

Scenario 3: Binding URI data to struct fails

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when there is an error binding URI data to the request struct.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock context with an invalid request that will fail the `ShouldBindUri` operation and set up the server with a mock store that would otherwise return a successful result.
  Act: Invoke `getAccountGraph` with the mock context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is `http.StatusBadRequest` and the response body contains an appropriate error message.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that when URI binding fails, the function does not proceed with the operation and informs the client of the bad request. This test is important for client-side debugging and validation of the request format.

Scenario 4: Data store returns an error when fetching graph data

Details:
  Description: The test aims to confirm that the function responds correctly when the data store is unable to fetch the account graph data due to an internal error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock context with a valid request and set up the server with a mock store that returns an error for `GetAccountsGraph`.
  Act: Invoke `getAccountGraph` with the mock context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is `http.StatusInternalServerError` and the response body contains an error message reflecting the failure to fetch data.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the function handles internal errors gracefully by sending an appropriate response to the client. It is critical to test this scenario to ensure the reliability of the service and proper error reporting to clients.

Scenario 5: Missing or invalid parameters in the request

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function responds with an appropriate error when the request is missing required parameters or contains invalid parameter values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock context with a request that lacks required parameters or has invalid parameter values and set up the server with a mock store that would otherwise return a successful result.
  Act: Invoke `getAccountGraph` with the mock context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is `http.StatusBadRequest` and the response body contains an error message indicating the invalid or missing parameters.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the function checks for the presence and validity of required parameters and informs the client of any issues with the request. This test is vital for ensuring that the API contract is enforced and that clients receive clear messages about request format issues.
