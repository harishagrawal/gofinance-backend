================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The function 'deleteCategory' does not validate or sanitize the 'req.ID' before it is used in an SQL query, which may allow for SQL injection if the ID is controllable by an attacker.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the 'database/sql' package to ensure that 'req.ID' is properly escaped.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Detailed SQL errors are returned directly to the client, which can leak sensitive information about the database schema or server configuration.
Solution: Log detailed errors internally and return generic error messages to the client.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: The 'errOnValiteToken' typo suggests potential issues in the token validation function that could allow brute-forcing of tokens due to lack of rate limiting or lockout mechanisms.
Solution: Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks. Also, correct the typo to 'errOnValidateToken' to avoid confusion.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: The function does not check if the user has the correct permissions to delete the category, potentially allowing an authenticated user to delete resources they should not have access to.
Solution: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) checks to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to perform the delete operation.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
Issue: Assuming util.GetTokenInHeaderAndVerify uses JWT tokens without proper salting, this could make tokens vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.
Solution: Ensure that JWT tokens are generated with a unique, per-token salt or use a strong, slow hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful category deletion

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `deleteCategory` function successfully deletes a category when provided with a valid token and category ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `util.GetTokenInHeaderAndVerify` to return `nil` and `server.store.DeleteCategories` to return `nil` as well, indicating no errors. Prepare a `gin.Context` with a valid category ID in the URI.
  Act: Call `server.deleteCategory` with the prepared `gin.Context`.
  Assert: The response code should be `http.StatusOK` and the response body should be `true`.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the expected behavior that when a category is successfully deleted, the function should respond with an `http.StatusOK` and a `true` value. This test is important to confirm that the category deletion process is working as intended and that the endpoint responds correctly.

Scenario 2: Invalid token provided

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `deleteCategory` function returns early without attempting to delete a category if the token validation fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `util.GetTokenInHeaderAndVerify` to return an error. Prepare a `gin.Context` with necessary values.
  Act: Call `server.deleteCategory` with the prepared `gin.Context`.
  Assert: Validate that `server.store.DeleteCategories` is never called and no response is written to the `gin.Context`.
Validation:
  The assertion here ensures that the function does not proceed with the deletion process if the token is invalid. This test is crucial for security reasons as it ensures that unauthorized requests are not able to delete categories.

Scenario 3: Category ID not provided

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `deleteCategory` function responds with `http.StatusBadRequest` when the category ID is not provided in the URI.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `util.GetTokenInHeaderAndVerify` to return `nil` and prepare a `gin.Context` without a category ID in the URI.
  Act: Call `server.deleteCategory` with the prepared `gin.Context`.
  Assert: The response code should be `http.StatusBadRequest` and the response body should contain an error message.
Validation:
  The expected result is based on the RESTful API convention that a request with missing required parameters should result in a `http.StatusBadRequest`. This test ensures that the function is robust against malformed requests.

Scenario 4: Database error during category deletion

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the `deleteCategory` function responds with `http.StatusInternalServerError` if there is a database error during the deletion process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `util.GetTokenInHeaderAndVerify` to return `nil` and `server.store.DeleteCategories` to return a database error. Prepare a `gin.Context` with a valid category ID in the URI.
  Act: Call `server.deleteCategory` with the prepared `gin.Context`.
  Assert: The response code should be `http.StatusInternalServerError` and the response body should contain an error message.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that in the event of a database error, the API responds with the correct HTTP status code and provides an error message. This test is important for handling unexpected issues gracefully and informing the client of the issue.

Scenario 5: Category does not exist

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `deleteCategory` function responds with `http.StatusOK` and `true` even if the category to be deleted does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `util.GetTokenInHeaderAndVerify` to return `nil` and `server.store.DeleteCategories` to return `nil`, simulating a case where the category does not exist in the database. Prepare a `gin.Context` with a non-existent category ID in the URI.
  Act: Call `server.deleteCategory` with the prepared `gin.Context`.
  Assert: The response code should be `http.StatusOK` and the response body should be `true`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function behaves idempotently by returning a success status even if the category does not exist, as the end state of the system is the same (the category is not in the database). This test is important to ensure that the endpoint behaves predictably and does not leak information about the existence of resources.
