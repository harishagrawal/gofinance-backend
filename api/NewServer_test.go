================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: The '/login' endpoint may be vulnerable to brute force attacks as there is no middleware to limit authentication attempts.
Solution: Implement rate limiting middleware for the '/login' endpoint to limit the number of authentication attempts over a set period of time.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: Dynamic SQL queries in handlers could lead to SQL injection if user input is not properly sanitized.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods that automatically handle input sanitization to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: Gin's Default() function uses a middleware that logs all requests including sensitive data, which might be inadvertently exposed.
Solution: Configure a custom logger middleware that excludes sensitive information from logs or use Gin's ReleaseMode to disable debug logging in production.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Hardcoded Credentials
Issue: If any credentials are hardcoded within the application or its configuration files, they could be exposed to unauthorized users.
Solution: Remove hardcoded credentials and use environment variables or a secure vault service to manage application secrets.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Exposing detailed error messages or stack traces in the API responses could leak sensitive information.
Solution: Implement custom error handling to return generic error messages to the client, while logging the detailed errors server-side.

Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: Sessions may not expire after a reasonable period or after password changes, which can lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Implement session expiration and renewal policies, especially after password changes, to minimize the risk of session hijacking.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Server Creation with a Valid SQLStore

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the NewServer function creates a server instance with initialized routes when provided with a valid SQLStore.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock SQLStore instance.
  Act: Call the NewServer function with the mock SQLStore instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned Server instance is not nil and that its router has the expected routes initialized.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the function creates a non-nil Server instance, which is crucial for the application to serve API endpoints. The presence of initialized routes in the server's router confirms that the server is ready to handle the defined API calls, meeting the application's business requirements.

Scenario 2: Server Creation with a nil SQLStore

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the NewServer function when provided with a nil SQLStore, expecting it to handle the situation gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a nil SQLStore instance to the function.
  Act: Call the NewServer function with nil as the argument.
  Assert: Check that the function handles the nil input without panicking and returns a Server instance with no initialized routes.
Validation:
  Asserting that the server can be created with a nil SQLStore without causing a panic is important for the robustness of the application. The server should not crash, but it should not have any routes set up, as the store is essential for route handlers to function.

Scenario 3: Route Handler Invocation for createUser

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the server's createUser handler is callable and processes requests correctly when the server is instantiated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock SQLStore and an HTTP test client. Start the server with the NewServer function.
  Act: Use the test client to send a POST request to the "/user" endpoint.
  Assert: Check that the response status code is as expected (e.g., 200 OK or 400 Bad Request if input validation fails) and that the createUser handler is invoked.
Validation:
  This test validates that the server's createUser route is correctly set up and the handler is functional. It's essential to ensure that the API endpoints are accessible and behave correctly, fulfilling the intended user creation functionality.

Scenario 4: Route Handler Invocation for getUser

Details:
  Description: Verifies that the getUser route handler is reachable and behaves correctly when a GET request is made with a valid username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the SQLStore, start the server using NewServer, and create an HTTP test client.
  Act: Send a GET request to "/user/:username" with a valid username path parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the response code and body match the expected output and that the getUser handler processes the request.
Validation:
  This scenario checks both the accessibility of the getUser API endpoint and the correctness of its response. It's an important test to confirm that user retrieval functionality is working as per the application's requirements.

Scenario 5: Error Handling for getUser with Invalid Username

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the getUser route handler deals with invalid usernames by returning an appropriate error response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock SQLStore, start the server, and create an HTTP test client.
  Act: Send a GET request to "/user/:username" with an invalid or non-existent username.
  Assert: Expect an error status code (e.g., 404 Not Found) and an appropriate error message in the response body.
Validation:
  The purpose of this test is to verify the API's error handling capabilities. It's crucial that the server responds with the correct HTTP status code and message when a user is not found, maintaining API contract integrity and user experience.

Scenario 6: Server Shutdown and Resource Cleanup

Details:
  Description: This test assesses the server's ability to shut down gracefully and clean up resources.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock SQLStore, start the server using NewServer, and then initiate a shutdown sequence.
  Act: Trigger the server shutdown (this might involve calling a method or sending a signal that is handled to stop the server).
  Assert: Confirm that the server stops listening for new requests and that all resources (e.g., database connections) are properly released.
Validation:
  Ensuring the server can shut down cleanly is important for resource management and application stability. This test makes sure that the server does not leave any resources hanging, which could lead to memory leaks or other issues.

These scenarios provide a comprehensive starting point for testing the NewServer function, covering the creation of the server, route initialization, route handling, error handling, and server shutdown. Each test is designed to verify a specific aspect of the server's behavior, ensuring that the application's API layer functions correctly and meets business requirements.
