ROOST_METHOD_HASH=login_e69d46d140
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=login_5743050a86

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
Issue: The password is hashed using SHA-512 without a salt, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.
Solution: Use bcrypt directly on the user's password input for hashing and storing passwords, as it includes a salt as part of the hashing process.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: SHA-512 is used for hashing passwords, which is not recommended for password storage due to its speed, allowing for efficient brute-force attacks.
Solution: Replace SHA-512 with bcrypt for password hashing, which is designed to be slow and includes a salt to protect against precomputed hash attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-321: Hardcoded Sensitive Data
Issue: The JWT signing key is hardcoded into the application, which could be leaked and compromise the token's integrity.
Solution: Move the JWT secret key to an environment variable or secure configuration that is not stored within the source code.

Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: The JWT token expiration is set to 100 minutes, which may be too long for certain sensitive applications.
Solution: Consider shortening the token's lifespan and implementing a refresh token mechanism for prolonged sessions.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The application does not validate the JSON input strictly, which might lead to unexpected behavior or injection attacks.
Solution: Implement strict input validation using a JSON schema or manual checks before processing the input data.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Returning detailed error messages with 'errorResponse(err)' could expose sensitive information about the application's internal workings.
Solution: Return generic error messages to the client and log detailed errors internally.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: The application does not implement any rate limiting on login attempts, making it vulnerable to brute force attacks.
Solution: Implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful User Login

Details:
  Description: This test checks the successful login flow, where the user provides a valid username and password, and the server returns a valid JWT token.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database that returns a user with a bcrypt-hashed password matching the login request. Set up the gin context with the request data.
  Act: Invoke the `login` function with the gin context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is `http.StatusOK` and that a valid JWT token is returned.
Validation:
  A successful login should result in a 200 status code and a valid JWT token in the response. This test ensures that the authentication process is working correctly and users can access the system when providing valid credentials.

Scenario 2: Invalid JSON Body in Request

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the login function when an invalid JSON body is provided in the request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the gin context with an invalid JSON body.
  Act: Invoke the `login` function with the gin context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is `http.StatusBadRequest` and that an error message is returned.
Validation:
  The test checks if the login function correctly handles JSON binding errors, which is crucial for client-side debugging and preventing server-side crashes due to malformed input.

Scenario 3: Non-existent User Login Attempt

Details:
  Description: This test ensures the login function correctly handles attempts to log in with a username that does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock database that returns `sql.ErrNoRows` when attempting to retrieve the user. Set up the gin context with the request data.
  Act: Invoke the `login` function with the gin context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is `http.StatusNotFound` and that an appropriate error message is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the system properly handles login attempts with non-existent usernames by returning a 404 status code, informing the client that the username was not found.

Scenario 4: Database Error During User Retrieval

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the login function handles unexpected database errors during user retrieval.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database that returns a generic error when attempting to retrieve the user. Set up the gin context with the request data.
  Act: Invoke the `login` function with the gin context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is `http.StatusInternalServerError` and that an error message is returned.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the server responds appropriately to unexpected backend errors, maintaining the reliability and stability of the application.

Scenario 5: Incorrect Password Provided

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the login function's behavior when a user provides an incorrect password.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database that returns a user with a bcrypt-hashed password that does not match the provided password. Set up the gin context with the request data.
  Act: Invoke the `login` function with the gin context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is `http.StatusUnauthorized` and that an error message is returned.
Validation:
  The test confirms that the system denies access and alerts the client with a 401 status code when an incorrect password is entered, which is crucial for security.

Scenario 6: JWT Token Generation Failure

Details:
  Description: This test scenario ensures that the login function properly handles failures during JWT token generation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database that returns a valid user. Set up the gin context with the request data. Mock the JWT token generation to return an error.
  Act: Invoke the `login` function with the gin context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is `http.StatusInternalServerError` and that an error message is returned.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the token generation process and ensures that the server can handle token-related errors gracefully, without exposing sensitive information or crashing.

Scenario 7: Invalid Bcrypt Hash in Stored Password

Details:
  Description: This test checks the login function's behavior when the password stored in the database has an invalid bcrypt hash.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database that returns a user with an invalid bcrypt hash for the password. Set up the gin context with the request data.
  Act: Invoke the `login` function with the gin context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status is `http.StatusInternalServerError` and that an error message is returned.
Validation:
  This test is critical for ensuring that the application can handle corrupted or invalid password hashes without causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
