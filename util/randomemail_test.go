Scenario 1: Random Email Generation Test

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the RandomEmail function is behaving as expected. It is supposed to generate a random email from a string with a specific length.
  
  Execution:
    Arrange: We don't need any specific data, mocks, or test doubles for this test.
    Act: Invoke RandomEmail with a known integer, such as 10.
    Assert: The returned email should be a string of length 10 + length of "@email.com". The string should also contain "@email.com".

  Validation:
    The validity of the assertion is based on the expected behavior of the RandomEmail function - it should produce a string of certain character length and end with "@email.com". The test is important in verifying that the system is generating emails with the correct format and character length.

Scenario 2: Edge Case for Zero characters Test

  Details:
    Description: This test checks how the function behaves when asked to generate a zero-character-length string. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
    Act: Invoke RandomEmail with 0.
    Assert: The function should produce "@email.com".

  Validation:
    Assert logic is based on the fact that RandomString would generate an empty string with length 0, so the final email should only contain "@email.com". This test ensures that even when the function faces extreme input, it still behaves as expected.

Scenario 3: Edge Case for Negative characters Test

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function behaves correctly when passed a negative number as the string length.

  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
    Act: Invoke RandomEmail with a negative integer, like -10.
    Assert: The outcomes for this test could be dependent on the RandomString function. If it handles negative inputs well, by converting them to positive, then we expect a valid random email with positive length, otherwise, it might lead to an error.

  Validation:
    We expect the RandomEmail function to handle such edge cases gracefully. If not, it indicates that proper input validation should be added to prevent such occurrences. This test is important in ensuring that our system withstands negative inputs.

// This test uses the "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert". It uses table-driven tests to test three scenarios; a positive length, zero length and a negative length input. If the RandomString function accepts negative values then it is assumed that it returns string of positive length. For negative inputs, it's better for RandomEmail function to handle it by itself. For more accurate results, it's needed to know how the RandomString behaves. This test just provides the basic situations and validation based on assumptions. In real production scenarios, RandomEmail function should be updated to handle those edge cases and their tests accordingly.

// TODO: Add more tests for different edge cases. Add enough cases based on the behaviour of RandomString function which is called from RandomEmail function.
