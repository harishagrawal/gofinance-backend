ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getUser_35b9f0de28

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Returning SQL error messages directly to the client can expose underlying database schema or implementation details.
Solution: Implement custom error handling that returns generic error messages to the client.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The user object is returned with all its fields, which may include sensitive information such as passwords or tokens.
Solution: Create a separate struct for the API response that only includes the fields that should be visible to the client.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Distinguishing between 'not found' and other types of SQL errors can help an attacker infer valid usernames.
Solution: Use the same error response for both 'not found' and other SQL errors to avoid leaking information about user existence.

Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: The code does not demonstrate any session management, which could lead to session fixation or hijacking vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement proper session management with secure, unique session tokens and enforce session expiration.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: There are no controls to prevent brute-force attacks on user accounts.
Solution: Implement account lockout mechanisms or progressive delays after a certain number of failed authentication attempts.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of an existing user

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the getUser function correctly retrieves a user that exists in the database without any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database response to return a valid user object when GetUser is called with a specific username.
  Act: Call getUser with a context containing a valid username in the URI.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is http.StatusOK and the response body contains the user data.
Validation:
  Assert that the status code is 200 and the user data in the response matches the mock data. This test validates the function's ability to retrieve and return user data successfully, which is a core requirement for user management in the application.

Scenario 2: User not found in the database

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the getUser function returns a not found status code when the requested user does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database response to return a sql.ErrNoRows error when GetUser is called with a non-existing username.
  Act: Call getUser with a context containing a non-existing username in the URI.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is http.StatusNotFound and the response body contains an appropriate error message.
Validation:
  Assert that the status code is 404 and the error message is present in the response. This test confirms that the function handles the case of a non-existent user correctly, which is important for providing clear feedback to the client.

Scenario 3: Database error during user retrieval

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the getUser function handles generic database errors gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database response to return a generic error when GetUser is called.
  Act: Call getUser with a context that triggers a database error.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is http.StatusInternalServerError and the response body contains an error message.
Validation:
  Assert that the status code is 500 and the error message communicates a server error. This test ensures that the function does not expose sensitive information and informs the client of an internal issue.

Scenario 4: Invalid username parameter in URI

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the getUser function returns a bad request status code when the URI does not contain a valid username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the context with an invalid URI that does not conform to the expected parameters for binding a username.
  Act: Call getUser with the context containing the invalid URI.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is http.StatusBadRequest and the response body contains an error message.
Validation:
  Assert that the status code is 400 and the error message indicates a problem with the client's request. This test is crucial to ensure that the function validates and responds to incorrect input as expected.

Scenario 5: Malformed context or request during binding

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the getUser function returns a bad request status code when the context is malformed or cannot be bound to the expected request parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a context with a malformed request or improperly set parameters that will fail during the ShouldBindUri process.
  Act: Call getUser with the malformed context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is http.StatusBadRequest and the response body contains an error message.
Validation:
  Assert that the status code is 400, indicating that the request could not be processed due to client error. This test ensures robustness in the face of malformed requests.
