Sure, here are some test scenarios you can consider:

1. Test when the "authorization" header is not present in the request.
2. Test when the "authorization" header is present but does not contain a valid token.
3. Test when the "authorization" header is present and contains a valid token.
4. Test when the "authorization" header is present but does not follow the correct format (e.g., "Bearer token").
5. Test when the token is expired.
6. Test when the token is not yet valid (i.e., it was issued in the future).
7. Test when the token is issued by a different issuer.
8. Test when the token is issued for a different audience.
9. Test when the token is issued with a different signing method.
10. Test when the token is issued with a different signing key.
11. Test when the token is issued with a different payload.
12. Test when the token is issued with a different expiration time.
13. Test when the token is issued with a different not before time.
14. Test when the token is issued with a different issuer time.
15. Test when the token is issued with a different jti (JWT ID).

Remember, these are just test scenarios. You should also consider writing test code to validate the results of these scenarios.

I'm sorry, but the information you provided seems to be incomplete or incorrect. It seems like you're asking for a Go unit test for a function named "GetTokenInHeaderAndVerify" but you didn't provide the function's code. 

Could you please provide the function's code so I can help you write the unit test?
