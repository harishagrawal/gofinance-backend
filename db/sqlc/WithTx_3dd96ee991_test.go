/*
To create test scenarios for the `WithTx` function, you can consider various cases and use cases the function might encounter in actual use. Here are some test scenarios you might write out, remembering not to write test code, but rather to describe what should be tested:

1. **Transaction provided scenario**:
  - Description: Ensure that when passing a valid `sql.Tx` transaction, `WithTx` returns a new instance of `Queries` with the transaction set as its underlying database.

2. **Nil transaction scenario**:
  - Description: Test the behavior of `WithTx` when a `nil` transaction is given. This should either return a new instance of `Queries` with a nil database or handle the situation according to the design (e.g., return the same instance, throw an error, etc.).

3. **Closed transaction scenario**:
  - Description: Check how `WithTx` handles a transaction that has already been committed or rolled back (closed transaction). Expectation: The function might return a new `Queries` instance that, when used, should not be able to perform any database operations.

4. **Concurrent transaction usage scenario**:
  - Description: Verify that when `WithTx` is called concurrently with the same transaction, it returns separate instances of `Queries` that do not interfere with one another's operations.

5. **Transaction commit scenario**:
  - Description: Test using `WithTx` within a transaction and commit the transaction afterward to ensure that the operations within the transaction persist in the database as expected.

6. **Transaction rollback scenario**:
  - Description: Test using `WithTx` within a transaction and roll back the transaction afterward to ensure that the operations within the transaction do not persist in the database.

7. **Repeated calls with the same transaction**:
  - Description: Call `WithTx` multiple times with the same transaction object and validate that each call produces a distinct `Queries` object that operates within the same transaction context.

8. **Different transactions scenario**:
  - Description: Call `WithTx` with different transaction objects and ensure that the resulting `Queries` instances are independent and perform their operations within their respective transactions.

9. **Error propagation scenario**:
  - Description: Ensure that any errors encountered during operations performed using the `Queries` instance generated by `WithTx` are propagated appropriately and can be caught and handled by the calling function.

10. **Successful operation scenario**:
  - Description: Validate that `WithTx` does not interfere with successful database operations, such as queries or updates done within a transaction.

11. **Database disconnection scenario**:
  - Description: Evaluate the behavior of the `Queries` instance obtained from `WithTx` when the database connection is lost or deliberately closed. Ensure that operations fail gracefully and report the correct error.

Each of these scenarios would help verify the correctness of the `WithTx` function by simulating various real-world situations. To proceed with these scenarios, one would typically implement unit tests that set up the necessary conditions, execute the function, and assert the expected outcomes.
