ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getAccountReports_2b8a54e09a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The function 'getAccountReports' does not check the user's permission level before fetching reports, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive financial data.
Solution: Implement proper authorization checks to ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions to view the account reports.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The parameters 'UserID' and 'Type' are used in the SQL query without proper validation or use of prepared statements, potentially leading to SQL injection if the input is not properly sanitized.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, and ensure input validation is performed before using the data in SQL queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'getAccountReportsRequest' struct is not validated for correctness, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when invalid data is received.
Solution: Implement input validation logic for 'getAccountReportsRequest' to ensure that the data conforms to expected formats and ranges.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The error message returned by 'errorResponse(err)' may contain sensitive information about the internal workings of the application or database, which could be useful to an attacker.
Solution: Do not expose detailed internal error messages to the client. Instead, log the detailed errors internally and present a generic error message to the user.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: There is no explicit check to ensure that the 'UserID' from the request actually corresponds to the authenticated user, which could lead to privilege escalation.
Solution: Verify that the 'UserID' obtained from the request matches the authenticated user's ID to prevent unauthorized access to other users' data.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: The function 'GetTokenInHeaderAndVerify' does not appear to implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms, which may allow brute force attacks on user tokens.
Solution: Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms to protect against brute force attacks on authentication tokens.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of account reports

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly retrieves account reports given a valid user ID and type, and returns the expected response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database and inject it into the server. Set up the necessary context with valid request parameters and a mocked successful response from the database call.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccountReports` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the context's JSON function is called with `http.StatusOK` and the mock response from the database.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to confirm that the function responds with the correct HTTP status code and the expected body. This test is crucial to ensure that users can successfully retrieve their account reports, which is a core feature of the application.

Scenario 2: Invalid token in the request header

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's response when an invalid token is provided in the request header.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the context with an invalid token in the request header.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccountReports` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns early without calling the database, and no response is written to the context.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to ensure that the function enforces authentication and does not proceed with unauthorized requests. This test is important for application security, preventing unauthorized access to account reports.

Scenario 3: Failure to bind URI parameters

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function responds with a bad request status when URI parameters cannot be bound to the expected request structure.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the context with URI parameters that do not match the expected structure.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccountReports` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the context's JSON function is called with `http.StatusBadRequest` and the error message.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to verify that the function handles incorrect URI parameters gracefully by informing the client with an appropriate error message. This test is important for user experience and error handling.

Scenario 4: Database error when retrieving reports

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's error handling when the database call fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database that returns an error on the `GetAccountsReports` call and inject it into the server. Set up the context with valid request parameters.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccountReports` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the context's JSON function is called with `http.StatusInternalServerError` and the error message.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function correctly handles database errors by responding with an internal server error status. This test is important to ensure that the application can handle unexpected backend errors gracefully.

Scenario 5: Missing or malformed request parameters

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when request parameters are missing or malformed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the context without the required request parameters or with malformed data.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccountReports` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the context's JSON function is called with `http.StatusBadRequest` and the error message.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function validates the request parameters and responds with an appropriate error message when they are missing or malformed. This test is essential for maintaining data integrity and providing clear feedback to the client.

Scenario 6: Correct response format and data

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function returns the correct response format and data structure when the database call is successful.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock database that returns a successful response with the expected data structure and inject it into the server. Set up the context with valid request parameters.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccountReports` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the context's JSON function is called with `http.StatusOK` and the data structure matches the expected format.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the integrity of the response format, ensuring that the client receives the data in a consistent and expected structure. This test is significant for client applications relying on a specific data format for account reports.
