/*
To develop test scenarios for the `GetUser` function, we need to consider different aspects of the function behavior, input parameters, and the possible database states. Below are some potential test scenarios that would help to validate the function adequately:

1. **Valid Username**: Test with a valid username that exists in the database, and verify that the function returns the correct `User` struct with expected data and no error.

2. **Non-Existent Username**: Test with a username that does not exist in the database, and verify that the function returns a `User` struct with zero values and an appropriate "not found" error.

3. **Database Connection Issues**: Simulate a scenario where the database connection is down or unstable, and verify that the function returns an appropriate error regarding the database connectivity.

4. **Empty Username**: Test with an empty string for the username parameter, and make sure the function handles this gracefully, either by returning an error indicating that the username is invalid or by returning a zero-value `User` struct.

5. **SQL Injection Attempt**: Test with a username containing SQL injection code to ensure that the function properly sanitizes input and prevents injection attacks.

6. **Long Username**: Test with a username that exceeds the expected length limit to check how the function handles excessively long input.

7. **Special Characters in Username**: Test usernames containing special characters, spaces, or non-ASCII characters to verify that the function handles such cases correctly.

8. **Timeout Context**: Provide a context with a very short timeout duration to the function to test how it behaves when a timeout occurs during the database operation.

9. **Canceled Context**: Pass a context that is already canceled before the function call and verify that the function responds appropriately to the context cancellation.

10. **Concurrent Access**: Test the function with multiple concurrent calls with the same and different usernames to ensure that it can handle concurrency without deadlocks or race conditions.

11. **Partial Database Data**: Create a test scenario where the database contains partial or corrupted data for a user record (e.g., missing email or password) and verify that the function returns an error indicating the issue.

12. **Case-Sensitive Username Lookup**: If the username field is case-sensitive, test the function with different cases (upper, lower, mixed) and verify that the function behaves consistently according to the database's case-sensitivity setting.

13. **Database Connection Configuration Errors**: Test the behavior of the function when the database connection is improperly configured (e.g., wrong credentials, invalid host).

14. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Modify the database schema so that it does not match what is expected by the function (e.g., different column names, additional columns) and test to see if the function fails gracefully.

15. **Successful Transaction Scope**: If the function is run within a transaction scope, verify that it effectively retrieves data and works well with other transactional operations.

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling that should provide a comprehensive understanding of the `GetUser` function's robustness and correctness.
