The given unit test code seems to be well written and should compile fine under 'go test -c -v'.

Here are the points I verify:
- The package name is correct and is 'util'.
- Unused imports are not present.
- Duplicate imports are not present.
- All the functions in the test file (TestRandomEmail and TestRandomString) are unique and do not duplicate any other function in the package.
- Test functions have the correct signature in Go. They accept `*testing.T` as a parameter and do not return anything.
- The comments with ROOST_METHOD_HASH and ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH are present and intact.
- There are no duplicate declarations when compared to the Golang source file.
- The declared types, consts, variables, and functions do not re-declare any existing ones in the package.

Now, if the tests are still failing to compile, please make sure:
- The functions `RandomEmail` and `RandomString` are defined in the 'util' package.
- These functions have correct signatures. For example, `RandomEmail` should accept an integer argument and return a string.

The test 'TestRandomString' is written very intuitively and should fail gracefully if the RandomString function doesn't handle negative or zero inputs correctly.

The test 'TestRandomEmail' checks if the generated emails are completely random and unique, have the correct length, include the correct domain, and also handles negative inputs by gracefully throwing a panic.

So provided everything is adhering to these checks, the test cases should compile and run as expected.
