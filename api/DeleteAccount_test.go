ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=deleteAccount_ab34f2a0a7

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: The token validation does not check if the token has expired, potentially allowing an expired token to be used if it is not invalidated properly.
Solution: Implement token expiration check and ensure expired tokens are not accepted. Use middleware for token validation and enforce expiration checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The 'DeleteAccount' function takes an ID from the URI and passes it directly to the database without validation, which could be vulnerable to SQL injection if the 'DeleteAccount' method does not properly sanitize input.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements in the 'DeleteAccount' method to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: The code does not enforce the use of HTTPS, which means that sensitive data could be transmitted in cleartext and intercepted by an attacker.
Solution: Enforce HTTPS by configuring the server to only serve over TLS and redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Detailed database errors are returned to the client, which could expose sensitive information about the database structure or server configuration.
Solution: Log the detailed error internally and send a generic error message to the client to avoid information leakage.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The code does not check user permissions before deleting an account, potentially allowing any authenticated user to delete any account.
Solution: Implement proper authorization checks to ensure that the authenticated user has the right permissions to delete the account.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: The function does not validate if the user performing the action is the owner of the account or has the right to delete it.
Solution: Verify that the user making the request is authorized to perform the delete operation on the specified account.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful account deletion

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteAccount function correctly deletes an account when provided with a valid token and valid account ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database with an existing account ID and a mock gin.Context with a valid token in the header.
  Act: Invoke the deleteAccount function with the mock context.
  Assert: Check that the response code is http.StatusOK and the response body is true.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the account deletion was successful and the server responded with the correct status code and body. This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected under normal conditions and fulfills the requirement to delete accounts.

Scenario 2: Invalid token in request header

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the deleteAccount function returns early without attempting to delete an account when the token in the request header is invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock gin.Context with an invalid token in the header.
  Act: Invoke the deleteAccount function with the mock context.
  Assert: Confirm that the function does not attempt to delete the account and returns before reaching the deletion logic.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function properly handles authentication errors. This test is crucial for security, as it prevents unauthorized users from deleting accounts.

Scenario 3: Account ID not provided in the request

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteAccount function responds with a BadRequest error when the account ID is not included in the request URI.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database and create a mock gin.Context without an account ID in the request URI.
  Act: Invoke the deleteAccount function with the mock context.
  Assert: Check that the response code is http.StatusBadRequest and the response body contains an error message.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function responds correctly to a malformed request. This test is important to ensure the robustness of the API and that it provides meaningful feedback to the client.

Scenario 4: Database error during account deletion

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteAccount function responds with an InternalServerError when there is a database error during the account deletion process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database to return an error when attempting to delete an account and create a mock gin.Context with a valid account ID.
  Act: Invoke the deleteAccount function with the mock context.
  Assert: Check that the response code is http.StatusInternalServerError and the response body contains an error message.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function properly handles database errors and communicates these errors back to the client. This test is important for error handling and to ensure the stability of the application.

Scenario 5: Account does not exist

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the deleteAccount function responds with an OK status even if the account to be deleted does not exist, following the idempotent behavior of DELETE operations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database to simulate that the account ID provided does not exist and create a mock gin.Context with a valid account ID.
  Act: Invoke the deleteAccount function with the mock context.
  Assert: Check that the response code is http.StatusOK and the response body is true, indicating that the operation was idempotent.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the function adheres to the principles of RESTful API design, where a DELETE operation should be idempotent. This test is important to ensure API predictability and proper client-server interaction.

// Suggestion for improvement in business logic (deleteAccount function):
// - Add missing return statement after bad request response
// - Handle sql.ErrNoRows case separately to return a 404 Not Found status code
// - Ensure that the response content type is set appropriately
