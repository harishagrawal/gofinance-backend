ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getAccount_6c4a342821

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The function 'getAccount' does not perform any authentication checks after validating the token, which might allow unauthorized access to account details if the token validation is bypassed or flawed.
Solution: Implement a robust authentication mechanism that verifies the identity of the user, and ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested account information.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The 'getAccount' function may expose sensitive account information without proper authorization checks, assuming the token validation is not strictly tied to user permissions.
Solution: Implement fine-grained access controls that check the user's permissions after token validation to ensure they are authorized to view the specific account details.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'getAccount' function does not handle the potential error from 'ctx.ShouldBindUri' properly. It continues execution even if there's an error, which could lead to undefined behavior or information disclosure.
Solution: Properly handle the error from 'ctx.ShouldBindUri' by returning an appropriate response and stopping further execution if an error occurs.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Returning SQL error messages directly in the response with 'errorResponse(err)' could potentially expose sensitive information about the database schema or internal workings of the API.
Solution: Mask SQL error messages with generic error responses to avoid revealing details about the database or application internals to the client.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: The code does not check if the user requesting the account information is the owner of the account or has the right to access it, which might lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure that the user making the request is the owner of the account or has explicit permission to access the requested account information.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of an account

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly retrieves an account given a valid ID in the request URI and a valid token in the header.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database to return a specific account when queried with a valid ID. Set up the request context with a valid token and the account ID in the URI.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccount` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is `http.StatusOK` and the response body contains the expected account details.
Validation:
  The assertion will check the status code and the response body to ensure they match the expected values. This test is crucial to confirm that users can successfully retrieve their account information when all conditions are met.

Scenario 2: Account not found

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function responds with the correct error message and status code when the specified account ID does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database to return `sql.ErrNoRows` when queried with a non-existent account ID. Set up the request context with a valid token and a non-existent account ID in the URI.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccount` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is `http.StatusNotFound` and the response body contains an appropriate error message.
Validation:
  The assertion will check for the correct status code and error message to ensure the function handles the case of non-existent accounts properly. This test is important to provide clear feedback to the user about the non-existence of the requested account.

Scenario 3: Invalid token in the header

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's response when the provided token in the header is invalid or expired.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the request context with an invalid or expired token and a valid account ID in the URI.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccount` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the function does not proceed to retrieve the account and no response is generated, as the function returns early.
Validation:
  The function is expected to validate the token before proceeding. The absence of a response will confirm that the function behaves as intended when faced with an invalid token. This test is important to ensure the security of account information.

Scenario 4: Database error during account retrieval

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function handles unexpected database errors gracefully during the account retrieval process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the database to return a general error when attempting to retrieve an account. Set up the request context with a valid token and a valid account ID in the URI.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccount` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is `http.StatusInternalServerError` and the response body contains an error message indicating a server error.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles database errors by returning an internal server error status code and an appropriate message. This test ensures that the application can handle unexpected errors without exposing sensitive information or crashing.

Scenario 5: Invalid account ID format in URI

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function responds to a request with an improperly formatted account ID in the URI.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the request context with a valid token and an invalid account ID format in the URI.
  Act: Invoke the `getAccount` function with the prepared context.
  Assert: Verify that the response status code is `http.StatusBadRequest` and the response body contains an error message related to the invalid URI format.
Validation:
  The assertion will ensure that the function returns a bad request error when the URI format is incorrect, which is important for user feedback and to prevent the server from processing malformed requests.
